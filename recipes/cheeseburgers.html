    <h2>Description</h2>  
        <p>Everyone loves a good cheeseburger, here is a basic recipe for one.</p> 
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Burger meat: I love the simplicity and quality of using frozen grass fed beef burgers from costco</li>
        <li>Buns: I prefer onion buns or potato buns, but any you like may be used</li>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>Tomatoe</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Pickles</li>
        <li>Red Onion</li>
        <li>Mayonaise</li>
        <li>Mustard</li>
        <li>Ketchup</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by arranging your ingredients in a clean area</li>
        <li>Heat up your grill or cast iron skillet</li>
        <li>Once up to temp, place patties on grill or skillet and press down</li>
        <li>Allow to cook undisturbed for around 3 minutes</li>
        <li>Gently lift one corner of one patty. If the patty begins to lift easily, continue to flip. If it sticks to the surface, give it another minute and try again</li>
        <li>Give the second side the same ammount of time as the first, flip to check that it has cooked evenly. More or less cooking time can be used to give the desired done-ness I like medium rare so 3 to 4 minutes per side is perfect</li>
        <li>Move finished patties to rest with cheese on top if desired</li>
        <li>Gently toast your buns</li>
        <li>Add desired condiments, burger, and toppings to buns</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
