    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Nothing warms the soul or fills the stomach quite like a bowl of ramen, here is my recipe for a delicious and easy bowl. 
        I take a lot of shortcuts with this recipe because I am usually pressed for time when I make it. Please take the following as a general guideline. </p> 
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Ramen Noodles</li>
        <li>Broth Mix</li>
        <li>Scallions</li>
        <li>Corn</li>
        <li>Cha Shu pork</li>
        <li>Seaweed</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Set out two pots each filled with water</li>
        <li>Set one pot to medium high heat and allow to come to a boil</li>
        <li>Add your eggs and cook for 6 minutes (exact time will be dependent on many factors including altitude, temp, and egg quality.. 6 minutes works for me</li>
        <li>While the eggs cook, prepare an ice bath by putting ice and cold water in a medium sized bowl</li>
        <li>After your eggs are cooked to your liking, pull them out and place them in the ice to halt the cooking. Shell them when they are cold enough to handle</li>
        <li>In the second bowl, your selected broth base will be added and brought up to a low boil</li>
        <li>Add in any ingredients to the broth that you would like to simmer, I add the scallions and corn</li>
        <li>Rinse your egg pot and fill it with water, bring it to a quick boil over high heat</li>
        <li>Add your noodles to the boiling water and cook them till just a hair over al dente</li>
        <li>Strain your noodles and add them to the broth with all remaining ingredients</li>
        <li>Season to your liking and serve while hot</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
        
    </ol>
