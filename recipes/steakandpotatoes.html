    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A classic dinner option that is both satisfying and delicious</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Steak: Cant go wrong with a New York Strip, or Filet Mignon cut</li>
        <li>Potatoes: I prefer a mix</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>Rosemary or thyme</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees</li>
        <li>Chop potatoes to desired size</li>
        <li>If you have a sous vide, get it out and preheat the water to 285 degrees</li>
        <li>Season the steaks generously with salt and pepper on all sides</li>
        <li>If using a sousvide, place the steaks into vaccum sealed bags with a slice of butter and your herbs</li>
        <li>Place the sealed bags into the circulating water and allow to cook for at least an hour</li>
        <li>Once your steaks have enjoyed their bath, set them aside while you preheat a cast iron skillet with a small ammount of olive oil in it over medium-low heat</li>
        <li>Toss the potatoes with olive oil and salt and pepper, use some of the rosemary or thyme as well but save enough for basting your stakes later</li>
        <li>Place the potatoes on a baking sheet and insert into the oven for 20 minutes</li>
        <li>When your potatoes are 10 minutes from complete, turn the heat up for the skillet and begin searing your steaks</li>
        <li>Give each side of each steak enough time to develop a crust</li>
        <li>Add liquid from the sousvide bags and an additional slice of butter or bit of olive oil, add herbs</li>
        <li>Baste steaks until they have achieved your desired crust level</li>
        <li>Allow steaks to rest while you pull the potatoes out and plate them, slice and serve steaks</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>

    </ol>
